# n8n-journey

 My journey of learning and building with [n8n](https://n8n.io) – including example workflows, automations, and notes.

## 📌 About Me

I'm a Automation consultant exploring the power of automation with n8n. This repo is my hands-on lab for building workflows that solve real problems.

## 🔧 What's Inside

- 📁 `/workflows`: Real n8n JSON flows with comments
- 📁 `/docs`: Notes and tutorials based on what I’ve learned
- 🎯 Use cases: Slack bots, email automations, webhook integrations, and more

## 🧠 Goals

- Learn by doing
- Share reusable n8n flows
- Build a public portfolio of automation projects
